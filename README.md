This is material of a guided lecture and wont be much help without such. Individual commands are explained while progressing through the script. Outputs are interpreted together on occurrence as well as intermediate files checked with "less" or "head".

If you need a "real" pipeline to process metabarcoding data, or if you otherwise refer to this script use this URL to the original analysis and complete data: https://github.com/molbiodiv/meta-barcoding-dual-indexing
